# gcrf
Fast, Exact and Multi-Scale Inference for Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Gaussian CRFs

Follow these steps to reproduce our 80.2 IoU on VOC 2012 test set.

0. Change the PATH to the VOC Dataset in scripts/resources/test_rtf_release.prototxt, scripts/flip_images.m, scripts/apply_dense_crf.m, scripts/average_lr.m

1. Compile caffe (caffe_deeplab2_lightweight)

2. Compile dense-crf (scripts/resources/densecrf)


3. For the remainder of the steps, go into the scripts directory as all paths in the scripts are relative.
cd scripts

4. Download the trained caffemodel from http://cvn.ecp.fr/personnel/siddhartha/finetuned_iter_10000.caffemodel, and place it into the scripts/resources directory.

wget http://cvn.ecp.fr/personnel/siddhartha/resources/finetuned_iter_10000.caffemodel

mv finetuned_iter_10000.caffemodel resources

5. Flip test images

We flip test images horizontally, and then average the scores. Use the matlab script: scripts/flip_images.m

6. Score images using trained model.

Use the bash script scripts/score_images.sh

The results are written to scripts/results/release

7. Average the flipped scores, generate results without crf.

Use the matlab script: scripts/average_lr.m

The averaged scores are written to scripts/results/scores

The segmentation maps without dense CRF are written to scripts/results/nocrf

The segmentation maps without dense CRF achieve 79.5 mean pixel IoU on VOC2012 test set.

The results are here: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/anonymous/BWYMCO.html

8. Apply dense CRF for object edge refinement.

Use the matlab script: scripts/apply_dense_crf.m

The densecrf post processed segmentations are written to scripts/results/crf

The densecrf post processed segmentation maps achieve 80.2 mean pixel IoU on VOC2012 test set.

The results are here: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/anonymous/UWGAFB.html
